WARNING: This is the ugliest and least elegant code I have ever written. Please do not take this to be representative of my value as a human being.

This file scrapes data from collegecatalog.uchicago.edu to find course information for the supplied major,
then prints out the information in tsv format, which can be directed to a file.
By default, this script formats the course number as a link for copy/pasting to Excel or Google Sheets.
The `--nolink` argument can be supplied to stop this.
This script relies on a bunch of fixed strings and assumptions about what data the server will send over.
It is therefore very vulnerable to any changes in formatting on the website.
Please do not read this code and think less of me because of it; I promise the code I write is normally nicer.

Usage is simply `catalog-to-tsv.py [subject]` with an optional --nolink argument.
Since it's 2am and I have actual work to do, the --nolink thing can only be used as the second argument.
Also, the name of the subject comes from the URL of the catalog page.
For example, English is 'englishlanguageliterature' and not 'english'.

Each entry lists, in order:
- The course number
- The course name
- Whether the course is offered in fall, then winter, then spring, then summer
- Whether the years the course is offered in alternate
- Instructors
- Prerequisites
- Equivalent courses
- The number of units
- Notes

The data also has a header row.
